# timecard
timecard is a command line time tracker written in Kotlin Native.
Easily clock in & out and check how much time you've worked and how long you've been on break.
Quite configurable within the app itself, from 24-hour time to formatting how time is displayed.

## Getting Started
1. See installation instructions in [releases](https://github.com/Stephen-Hamilton-C/timecard/releases/latest)
2. Open a terminal and run `timecard in` to clock in, `timecard out` to clock out, and simply `timecard` to see how many hours you've worked.
3. For a full list of commands, run `timecard help`.
